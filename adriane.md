  <h2>Adriane Schramm</h2>
  <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> January 2018</p>
  <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="http://adrianeschramm.com" target="_blank">AdrianeSchramm.com</a></p>
  <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Design & Development</p>

  <p>Adriane Schramm is an artist and a friend I very much admire. We talked about collaborating on this portfolio site for years. When she was ready to commit to it, we discussed the different kinds of work she's done. She spent some time scanning and categorizing her images before sending them over. From those images, I created a moodboard to make sure we were on the same page. Then I worked on wireframes. Eventually, we landed on this very colorful blog.</p>
