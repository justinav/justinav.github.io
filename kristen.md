  <p><strong>Scope:</strong> Design</p>
  <h3>Before</h3>
  <p>Kristen Sollee is a writer, researcher, professor and founder of Slutist.com. Previously, her site was hard to tell what it is she did, who she was, and as a user, I wasn't sure how to navigate from page to page. I wanted to make the navigation easier and to boldly declare Kristen's many talents.</p>

  <h3>During</h3>
  <p>We met for lunch and talked about what her aspirations for the next two years. I  sketched out some ideas with her. Then I came home and wireframed them.</p>

  <p>We communicated via email during the rest of the build. She would respond to wires and color options. I would refine and send her newer mocks, until she was happy with the feel. Then, I updated her SquareSpace with a new theme and worked from there to customize each section and page.</p>
