  <p><strong>Year</strong> 2016</p>
  <p><strong>Client</strong> Slutist.com</p>
  <p>I started by doing small changes for the site. I did a few quick css patch-ups (like fixing the navigation padding so all the links fit) and updated plugins. Still, the site crashed anytime WordPress updated (with that infamous White Screen of Death). It was clear that along with some style updates, the site needed a complete overhaul.</p>
  <p>The first order of business was making the site responsive because it was hard to read Slutist articles on mobile devices. After playing with some ideas in Photoshop. I started talking to Kristen (Slutist founder) about the site's biggest challenges. I built the prototype locally, then deployed a staging site. After two months of working out key elements, we arrived at a magazine-style grid layout.</p>
