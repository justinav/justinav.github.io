  <p><strong>Year</strong> 2015</p>
  <p><strong>Partner</strong> Mike Turbe</p>
  <p>It all started over lunch. Mike came up with the concept. He also already had some of the backend developed from another project. We both felt there was a strong need for an app that would allow folks to simply and quickly share what album they were listening to, without cluttering up Facebook and Twitter. I went from sketching some ideas on paper to drafting wireframes in Google Presentations, which made it easy to collaborate in real time.</p>
  <p>Once we reviewed all the wireframes together, I started putting together realistic comps in Sketch.</p>
