  <p><strong>Client</strong> Complex Networks</p>
  <p>Collider is one of the best sources for TV and Movie news and reviews. I was hired as a freelancer to research and design a refresh for the site. We user-tested via an InVision prototype and used that feedback to finalize the designs. Once I became staff, I worked closely with developers to bring those pixel perfect comps to life.</p>
